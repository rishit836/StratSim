# 📊 StratSim

**StratSim** is a Django-based backtesting and trading simulation platform that helps test and visualize trading strategies. It serves as my first portfolio project where I’m actively building and experimenting with the custom strategies I originally designed for **WalletTree** — my AI-based intelligent investing platform (currently in progress).

---

## 🧠 Why StratSim?

As someone exploring the intersection of **AI, investing, and quant strategy**, I needed a platform to:
- Test out and iterate on algorithmic trading strategies
- Simulate realistic market environments
- Track strategy performance over time

StratSim is the **starting point** of that journey.
